# How-UMHB-Students-Feel-About-Campus-Social-Life-on-the-Weekends

Weekends on college campuses create a large portion of the social life and vibrancy of a student body. The ways in which the university itself interacts with its students is essential to the belonging and satisfaction of students at the school. We researched the ways in which individuals who attended the University of Mary Hardin-Baylor felt about the social life on their campus during the weekend. We found that students see this time as a time to be productive instead of rest. This is a result of the lack of things to participate in on the weekends, as well as the lack of effective advertising for things that do occur during the weekends. We also found that students who feel less involved and connected to others will be less likely to stay during the weekends, perpetuating the expectation that no students will be present and that the campus will be empty. These findings will allow the university, and others like it, to see inside the minds of students who attend the school and experience social life on the weekends first hand.
